## Task 25 result

Repeated Task 90 addresses `P3R-02`, `P3R-03`, `P3R-05` and `P3R-07`. Exact scope/architecture inventory evidence is query-bound rather than display-name-correlated; `ReInventoryAsync` and review-to-confirmation use current provider composition; native cleanup opens descendants with NT `FILE_OPEN`; production cache fixtures cover reparse root/final/repeated ancestor junctions; and quota includes safe crash orphans. [Evidence](review/TASK_90_P3RR_EVIDENCE.md) records focused 23, cache-hostile 9, hostile-root 42/1 skip, Release 0/0 and full-suite 154 results.

The gate remains FAIL until a fresh independent Task 25 reviewer assesses these changes. VM/manual exception scope is unchanged; no merge or Task 26 work is permitted.

## Residual risks and accepted deferrals

The recorded host substitute and personal-use UI waiver retain their narrow approved scope. Clean-image behavior, per-user no-prompt behavior, provider-disconnect cancellation, unconstrained hostile races, same-signer rollback and the un-replayed outcome dialog remain residual risks. ADR-003 and ADR-011 remain Provisional. `AC-UX-01–09` are Optional under ADR-021.

## Next task

Repeat Task 25 under fresh GPT-5.6 Sol / Extra High review. Do not merge Phase 3 or begin Task 26.

## Rules for updating this file

Keep it below 120 lines. Record only current state, unresolved blockers, last green commit, and next task. Historical detail belongs in Git, ADRs, review reports, or failure reports.
