## Task 25 result

The repeat review closes the configured-root ancestor escape in code and the mixed registered-file/orphan oldest-first defect. Release build remains 0 warnings/errors; security 16, architecture 4, focused integration 57, hostile script 42/1 skip and the full suite 160 all pass.

The gate remains **FAIL**. `P3R-03` is a Blocker because the approved elevated link/mount fixture predates the changed production root-opening primitive. `P3R-10` is High because the real WinGet scan always emits `Unknown` scope/architecture, making the new positive verification test impossible in desktop composition. `P3R-11` is High because cleanup directly reproduced deletion beneath an active extraction-directory lease. `P3R-12` is Medium because an already-absent registered artifact remains in the ledger while cleanup reports Success. See [the review](review/PHASE_3_SECURITY_REVIEW.md).

## Residual risks and accepted deferrals

The recorded host substitute and personal-use UI waiver retain their narrow approved scope. Clean-image behavior, per-user no-prompt behavior, provider-disconnect cancellation, unconstrained hostile races, same-signer rollback, same-user substitution of the name-based temporary export and the un-replayed outcome dialog remain residual risks. ADR-003 and ADR-011 remain Provisional. `AC-UX-01–09` are Optional under ADR-021.

## Next task

Stop here. Run Task 90 under GPT-5.6 Terra / High, then repeat Task 25 under fresh GPT-5.6 Sol / Extra High. Do not merge Phase 3 or begin Task 26.

## Rules for updating this file

Keep it below 120 lines. Record only current state, unresolved blockers, last green commit, and next task. Historical detail belongs in Git, ADRs, review reports, or failure reports.
